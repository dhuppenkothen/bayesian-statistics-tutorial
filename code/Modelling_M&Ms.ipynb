    "# Modeling M&M Colour Distributions \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will model M&M colour distributions using Bayesian inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic problem: You have a bag of M&Ms, and you want to know how many blue ones are in it. Easy, right? You open the bag, and count all the blue ones! But what if you have a [10 pound bag](https://www.mymms.com/product/bulk-mms-candy-10-lb.do?sortby=ourPicksAscend&refType=&from=fn&ecList=7&ecCategory=100601) of M&Ms? Counting them all would take you ages, wouldn't it? Or what if you had several bags. The exact number of blue M&Ms as well as the total number of M&Ms in each bag might vary! So really, what we need is a model of the *average* number of blue M&Ms per bag. We don't just need any model, but we need a *statistical* model that describes the number of blue M&Ms we would get out of a bag of M&Ms given some underlying true fraction of blue M&Ms. \n",

    "## The Binomial Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, the statistical model for how one draws observations given some underlying process is called the *likelihood*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we have two observations: the total number of M&Ms in a bag $N$, and the number of blue M&Ms out of that total number, $k$. \n",
    "There are only two things the M&Ms can be in our (simplified) model: blue and not-blue. It is worth noting at this point that virtually any model used to make sense of data is always a *simplification* of the true underlying process. In reality, M&Ms come in six different colours. We have *simplified* this to just two. This is fine as long as blue M&Ms are all we care about. If we suddenly also cared about green M&Ms, we'd need to make our model more complicated to account for this (more on this later)!\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our blue M&Ms. Every time you draw an M&M out of a bag, you get one of two outcomes: blue or not-blue. In a more statistical language, a draw of an M&M out of a bag is called a *trial*, drawing a blue M&M is called a *success* (a not-blue M&M is called a *failure*). You can do this $N$ times and then record the number of successes, $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that there is some underlying fraction $q$ of blue M&Ms being produced and put into bags, then for every time you draw an $M&M$ out of the bag, you will draw a blue one with probability $q$ and a not-blue one with probability $(1-q)$ (since these are our only two, mutually exclusive options, and all probabilities must sum up to $1$). \n",

On the right side is a probability $p$, and it's the probability of getting $k$ blue M&Ms out of a bag with $N$ total M&Ms, and an underlying fraction of $q$ blue M&Ms per total. The $|$ symbol always denotes the term *given*, which implies *truths* about the world, or things we know. In this case, we *know* that we've drawn $N$ M&Ms out of the bag, and we're trying to figure out how probable it is that $k$ will be blue, given some true underlying rate $q$. Note that here, we assume that we actually *know* what the true number of blue M&Ms per bag should be, but in reality, we don't! \n",
    "Keep this in the back of your head, we'll get back to it in a little while!\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left-hand side is the definition of the probability distribution we are interested in. The probability of drawing $k$ blue M&Ms is $q^k$ (if the draws are all independent). Then we have $N-k$ not-blue M&Ms left, and the probability of drawing those is $(1-q)^{N-k}$. The ${N choose k}$ term in the front of the expression comes from the fact that $q^k (1-q)^{N-k}$ is the probability of one *specific* sequence. For example, you could have drawn something like \\[blue, blue, not-blue, blue, not-blue, not-blue, not-blue, not-blue, blue\\], which is a specific sequence. But we don't really care about whether you draw a blue or not-blue first, all we care about is the total number of blue M&Ms out of the total. The first term corrects the expression for all possible permutations of sequences that could produce $k$ blue M&Ms out of $N$ total. \n",
    "\n",
    "This expression, as a whole, is called the *binomial distribution*, and is the likelihood we're going to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Without looking at any M&Ms, take a guess for what a reasonable value might be for $q$. Then open your bag of M&Ms and take out 30, recording all blue ones. Calculate the probability of that number of blue M&Ms out of your set of 30 trials, given the value of $q$ you've chosen. How large is that probability? \n"

    "\n",
    "There's a fundamental problem with the process above: it assumes we know $q$ (it's on the right side of the \"|\") and that $k$ is a random variable. But this is often not what we observe in reality! Often, we can make *observations* of the process (here: $k$ blue M&Ms out of $N$), and we care about the *parameters* of the underlying model (here: the success rate $q$). What we really want to know is not $p(k | N, q)$, but $p(q | N, k)$. It is important to realize that these two are not the same! For an illustrative example, consider a simpler case. Consider that you're given the information that it is raining outside. What can you conclude about the cloud cover overhead? Conversely, imagine you're being told the it is cloudy. Can you conclude with equal probability that it is also raining? \n",
    "\n",
    "So, if they're not the same, do we get from $p(k | N, q)$, which we've shown we can calculate, to $p(q | N, k)$? In principle, nothing stops you from measuring your $k$ successes out of $N$ trials, and then calculating $p(k | N, q)$ for different values of $q$. However, there is a reason this is called a likelihood *function*: it is *not* a probability distribution of the parameter $q$, because $q$ is on the right-hand side of the \"|\" sign. It is fixed, known, assumed to be true. The binomial probability is a probability distribution in $k$, not $q$. This may sound subtle, but has huge consequences, one of them being that $p(k | N, q)$ as a function of $q$ does not integrate to 1, like a proper probability distribution.\n",

In the case we're currently looking at, I already *know* that it's cloudy (maybe I've looked out of the window), and I'm curious whether I might be able to get to work without getting wet. So I already have one piece of information (it's cloudy). Because I already know this, the whole row labelled \"sunny\" no longer matters, and I only have two cases left (rain and not-rain). However, the sum of those two options is $0.5$, and I said earlier that probabilities must sum up to 1! So we'll need to re-normalize the probability to sum up to 1: \n",

In Bayesian statistics, almost anything can be a random variable, and Bayesians see probabilities as encoding our uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the world. Frequentists tend to have a more literal view of the world, and interpret probabilities as frequencies of truly random events, e.g. rolls of dice. \n",

We're not done, though. In particular, we've written down the equation, and we know how to calculate $p(k | N, q)$, but what are $p(q)$ and $p(x)$? \n",
    "\n",
    "I've made a big production above that $p(k | N, q)$ isn't normalized, and that this is important. The product $p(k | N, q) p(q)$ is still not normalized, but $p(q | N, k)$, so $p(k)$ is effectively a normalizing constant:\n",

    "such that the whole probability distribution integrates to 1. In practice, this is the probability of observing the data $k$ times $p(q)$, integrated over all possible values of $q$. This is also called the *marginal likelihood* or *evidence*. While this no longer depends on $q$, this doesn't mean it has no assumptions. For example, we've assumed above that our data can be modelled by a binomial distribution. This may not be true, and we should probably have included another variable $B$ on the given side of our probabilities to indicate there's an underlying assumption there, e.g. $p(k | B)$. Notice that this looks a lot like a likelihood? Well it is, but it is now the likelihood of observing the data given the generalized assumption that the data were drawn from any binomial distribution. If we had another model for the data, say a Poisson distribution, we could also calculate $p(k | P)$ (where $P$ stands for the Poisson model) and compare the two. This is why the marginal likelihood is often used for *model comparison*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're not going to worry about comparing different kinds of (statistical) models, but instead worry about estimating the parameter $q$. For this the normalizing constant $p(k)$ is exactly that, a constant, the same for all possible values of $q$. if we're only interested in the relative probabilities of a specific $q_0$ to a different $q_1$, we can ignore that constant and write\n",

    "## Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing we *haven't* talked about yet is $p(q)$. You'll notice that this is a probability distribution of $q$ only, without the data playing a role. This is often called the **prior probability distribution**, and it encodes whatever prior knowledge you might have about this parameter before you've looked at the data. For example, you might know that there are six colours in a package of M&M, so you might conclude that it's extremely unlikely that $q=1$, i.e. that there are only blue M&Ms in your bag. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Think about what you know about M&Ms. Do you have any prior knowledge about how many M&Ms there might be in a bag? Think about the number you picked for $q$ when you calculated the binomial probability earlier. Why did you pick that value? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Careful**: Of course, you've already seen the data! This is generally not how you go about things, so you're going to have to pretend you haven't (or take a new bag :) ). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I've said earlier that $p(q)$ is a probability *distribution*, so it has to be more than one value. It has to encode your knowledge about $q$ for all possible values of $q$, which can in principle be anywhere in the range between 0 and 1. One simple choice is to make all possible values of $q$ equally likely, but we've already said earlier that this is probably not a good assumption, because we don't think our bag will be all blue M&Ms. In general, this kind of prior is called a *uniform distribution*, and while it may seem like the choice that is least affected by what you know, this is in practice *not* always true! We won't go into the details here of why or when this is the case, but be mindful that this is something you might have to think about in practice. \n",
    "There's another thing to be aware of with the uniform distribution: it makes a very, very strong assumption about what values $q$ is allowed to take. If we set the prior to be uniform between $0$ and $1$, this would be an okay choice, because these are all the values $q$ can take in practice. However, imagine you picked a prior for $q$ between 0.5 and 1. You have just assumed that $q$ can *never, ever* be lower than 0.5, *no matter* what your data tell you! This is a really strong assumption to make, and you'd better be really sure that it's a reasonable one! \n",
    "In practice, it's often better to choose distributions that fall off sharply, but retain some (small, but not impossible) prior probability in all theoretically allowed values, unless you're absolutely confident that these values cannot be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conjugate Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "So in principle, you could choose any distribution for $q$. Maybe you eat a package of M&Ms every day, so you have a pretty good feeling for $q$. You could choose a normal distribution around your estimated value of $q = \\mu$, assign some narrow width $\\sigma$ to the distribution, and you'd have a perfectly good prior: $p(k | \\mu, \\sigma) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)$. Note that in this case $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ define the shape of the prior distribution, and are called **hyperparameters**. They're given (i.e we've set them in advance), so they're on the right-hand side of the \"|\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with this is that you don't just want to calculate $p(k | \\mu, \\sigma)$, but $\\propto p(k | N, q) p(q | \\mu, \\sigma)$, and there's no guarantee that the latter will be an analytically solveable equation for any choice of $p(k)$. However, for most likelihood functions, there do exist functions that you can use as priors that will lead to analytical expressions for the posterior. These are called **conjugate priors** and are a good choice when you don't have much prior information about your parameter $q$ and/or the conjugate prior matches the shape of what you *do* know about $q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The conjugate prior for the binomial distribution is the [beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). This distribution has two parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and is defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, you will often end up in situations where conjugate priors are not a good choice, and your posterior will not be analytical. What you do in this case depends on what you want to know. For example, you might only be interested in the *most probable* value of $q$. In this case, optimization algorithms are often a good choice. This is sometimes also your only option for example if the likelihood function is very expensive to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, often the posterior probability can be complex, and trying to find the most probable value isn't good enough. Imagine you had a probability distribution with two roughly equally tall peaks, at 0.2 and 0.8, with a valley of low probability in between. An optimization algorithm will always end up in one of the two peaks, and will give you a single value, but you might never find out about the other peak!\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can we do? If you need to map out the probability distribution as a whole, there are several approaches. The simplest and straightforward is to make a grid in $q$, e.g. of a 100 points, and calculate $p(q | N, k)$ for each of those points, and then plot the result. Easy, right? This works well for problems with very low dimensions, like ours, where we only have a single parameter. What if you don't have a single parameter, but 50? You now need to sample 100 points in each of those 50 dimensions, meaning you need $100^{50}$ points. If your posterior takes a microsecond to calculate, you'll still need longer than the age of the universe to calculate all of those points! This is clearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So can we do something smarter than a grid? Yes! In fact, we can find clever ways to jump through parameter space in such a way that we'll evaluate our posterior often in regions where the posterior is large, and less often in regions where the posterior is low. There are a whole range of different algorithms that can do this, but **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** is the most common and most popular one. \n",
