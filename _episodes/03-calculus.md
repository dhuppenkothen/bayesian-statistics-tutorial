So far, we have only encountered a fairly abstract definition of what probabilities are, and two examples: 
coin tosses (a very classical example that statisticians love very much), and the weather.

Let's take a look at a different example, important for anyone who has ever been to a scientific
conference: **Will there be cookies at coffee break?**

When working with probabilities, we usually use the notation `P(outcome)` to describe a probability of an
outcome. The "P" stands for "probability of" whatever follows in the round brackets, which should be
an identifier of whatever outcome you are trying to calculate the probability of. That could be a
word, like `P(cookies)`, or it could be a variable shorthand for that outcome, say `P(c)`, or
something else. For fun, here, we're going to use :cookie:.
